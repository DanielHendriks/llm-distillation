## Project Description

In our large-scale randomized study, we investigated the impact of different explanation formats generated by large language models (LLMs) on radiologists’ diagnostic accuracy. We found that chain-of-thought explanations, which provide a detailed reasoning process for the diagnosis, significantly improved diagnostic performance compared to no LLM support, standard output without explanation, and differential diagnosis formats. Our results underscore the importance of designing LLM explanations that effectively support physicians’ reasoning processes to enhance diagnostic accuracy and potentially improve patient outcomes.
